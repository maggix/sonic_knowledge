# Sonic

* Name: Maurice "Sonic" Takeshi Hedgehog
* Age: 16
* Species: Hedgehog
* Place of residence: Knothole Village / Floating Island

Impulsive, how else do you want a character who runs at supersonic speed to be? =) Thanks to this "innate gift" of his, he knows how to get into trouble with extreme ease, from which he always manages to get out, both thanks to his skills and thanks to his faithful friends. Loyal and courageous, he nevertheless rightly remains the leader of the "good guys". Sonic's story is not at all defined, first of all because there are various versions of it:
Sonic from the video games, American Sonic from the cartoons (basically Sonic from Archie Comics) and Sonic from the anime.
The character remains the same, but the background changes: according to the video games, Sonic lives in a non-well-defined place and is always ready to go into action supported by Tails, while for the American authors Sonic is part of the Freedom Fighters, the fighters for freedom ‡, who try to defeat Robotnik who has taken over the planet Mobius.
According to this plot he lives in Knothole, a village in the forest, and has as relatives his parents Jules and Bernie Hedgehog (transformed into robots by Robotnik) and Uncle Charles (better known as Uncle Chuck) who has been roboticized but still has a free mind by the influence of the machine he himself invented.
In the Sonic Anime (Sonic: The Movie) we instead see Sonic and Tails living on a floating island (all the continents of that world are suspended in the air) identical to the Angel Island of the games (where Sonic 3 takes place). Even the rings are different depending on the series: in the games we know well that they are used to obtain points, while according to the authors of Adventures Of Sonic The Hedgehog Uncle Chuck invented a device that generates one Power Ring per day, with a diameter of approximately 30 cm from which Sonic can draw energy and fight at full power.
On the contrary, we agree on the weapons at his disposal: Sonic performs the Spin Dash (i.e. rolling into a ball) in every series, while weapons such as the "guided" attack are an innate prerogative only with Sonic Adventure, but already ‡ present with Sonic 3D shields. In the games he can also create a shield around himself for a fraction of a second, and use the games' various power-ups. He is generally the fastest character among those selectable and can jump higher than the others.
His date of birth is 23 June 1991, release date of the first Sonic game.


# Tails

* Full Name: Miles "Tails" Prower
* Male
* Species: Fox (with two tails)
* Residence: Knothole Village / Floating Island

Tails "suffers" from the same problems that afflict Sonic: he does not have a universally accepted history. In Adventures Of Sonic The Hedgehog, Tails joins the Freedom Fighters group because he was abandoned by Sonic when he was little, and since then he has grown up admiring the exploits of his older friend, trying to emulate him.
This characteristic of his character, i.e. the continuous search to resemble Sonic, also characterizes his Japanese counterpart, and as always he does not realize that he has other potentials, equally useful in his adventures.
After some not very successful releases on Game Gear even as the main character of two games, his "sidekick" role has definitely weakened and now he boasts his own adventure.
If in America he is a child, in Japan he is much more enterprising, so much so that on the island where he lives with Sonic he has his own workshop where he works on various inventions. He is the pilot of Tornado, the red plane (later colored blue in Sonic Adventure) with which our heroes travel to come into action when they are needed: Tails in the command post and Sonic standing on top wings. In Sonic Adventure 2 Tornado was replaced by Cyclone, a robotic vehicle with which he will fight against Robotnik's Egg Walker.
His great main ability is to fly using his two tails as propellers, and the "flight time" is variable: if in the games Tails gets tired quickly, in the anime we will see him flutter much longer, on the contrary in the cartoons and American comics Tails learns to use his tails to fly thanks to Sonic who supports him morally, and will learn to use them in difficult moments, despite being in the air for a short time.

# Knuckles

* Name: Knuckles The Echidna
* Age: 17
* Species: Echidna
* Residence: Angel Island

Here is the "hard" part of the series: Knuckles, especially with Sonic Adventure, positioned himself as the character who doesn't look at anyone and follows his ideals and his destiny. Born on Angel Island, he is the guardian of the Master Emerald, the destiny of his entire species. Knuckles has no choice: he can only continue to save him from the clutches of those who threaten the peace of his island, and for this reason he will not hesitate to go against Sonic on several occasions (Sonic 3/Sonic 3 & Knuckles, Sonic Adventure) only to then understand the his mistake and fighting alongside the blue hedgehog, although he has never appreciated it and indeed is often reluctant to join forces.
He takes his destiny as a guardian very seriously, even if this seriousness is not compensated by record patience: more ready to fight than to argue, Knuckles offers a good variety of moves in his arsenal, and in each series he is presented like what he is, therefore there are no various versions of his life, although his family tree was later enriched with his father (Locke Echidna) and mother (Lara-Le Echidna).
Knuckles can fight with his fists (Sonic Adventure) and dig underground (also in Sonic Adventure), but he is better known for his wall-climbing and gliding abilities, which come from his first appearance in the world of video games (Sonic & Knuckles ).
In Knuckles's Chaotix, the echidna became the protagonist of a video game in which he is the leader of the Chaotix, a group of friends whose task is to maintain order and justice, which includes Julie-su, Charmy Bee, Vector Crocodile and others. From here some issues of comics dedicated exclusively to Knuckles were also born.


# Dr. Eggman

* Name: Dr. Eggman (Ivo Julian - Doctor Robotnik)
* Age: Unknown
* Year of birth: unknown
* Species: Human
* Place of residence: Robotropolis

Robotnik (Eggman in Japan) is well known as Sonic's number 1 enemy, and needs no introduction: since Sonic 1 he and his machines have been trying to defeat the blue hedgehog and his friends, and then controlling the world.
Despite years of defeats, he has always returned to battle and has practically never missed the call.
He had a "protagonist" role in the game Dr.Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine (not something to be proud of though...) and was a playable character in Sonic R, where as usual he shot missiles at his opponents, and in Sonic Adventure 2 he will apparently return among the characters that can be used in the game, and not just as an enemy.
Characterized by a "ball" body and a mustache that covers his mouth, Robotnik has a very different history in American comics and cartoons:
previously known as Ivo Julian, he was saved by Charles (Sonic's uncle) and his brother Jules from the clutches of the Outlanders, against whom a war was being fought. King Maximilian Acorn (Sally's father) appointed him commander of the Kingsguard, given his skills in warfare, and tasked him with fighting against the Outlanders. Having defeated those and made sure that everything was under control, he went further: he changed his name to Dr. Robotnik, marched against Mobotropolis and conquered it, and transformed all those who opposed him into obedient robots, thanks to the Roboticizer, the machine invented for charity by Sir Charles Hedgehog. The king has been relegated to another dimension, The Void, and the air has been polluted, the city partly destroyed and partly transformed into factories, metal buildings and barracks for his robot troops, the city has now taken the name of Robotropolis, and the only ones who still oppose his rule are the groups of Freedom Fighters (including that of Sonic, Sally, etc.) who hope one day to put an end to his rule.
Robotnik is extremely disloyal and cruel, seems to have no heart, and mercilessly commands his various subordinates; after all, is he or isn't he a bad guy?

# Amy

* Full Name: Amy Rose
* Female
* Species: Hedgehog
* Place of residence: unknown

Amy's origins are to be found in Sonic CD, and although her story is not explained, her origin has something to do with "Little Planet", or the small planet that appears only in certain periods of the year in which the story behind Sonic CD takes place. After being captured by Robotnik with the help of Metal Sonic and later freed by Sonic, with whom she fell in love (even though Sonic apparently has no intention of reciprocating).
Her weapons are not well defined, she seems to have hidden magical powers, and the rubber hammer that leaves little hearts when she hits her may be an example of this.
 Amy has more appearances in games than you might think, but not very lucky ones: if in Sonic CD and Sonic Fighters she had a rather important role, the two games were not particularly lucky, and in Sonic R she leads her ( SLOOOOW) red car was anything but exciting. Not even in Sonic Adventure Amy had a basic role, despite the restyling she had.
According to other sources (Radical City) after being freed by Sonic she moved to Knothole to help the Freedom Fighters, which however does not appear in the cartoon, and there is no mention of the fact that despite being in love with Sonic, Amy is the girl by Tails.
